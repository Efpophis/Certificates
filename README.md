# Certificates

A place to put my public keys so people can verify my stuff.

## Efpophis.net CA

I created my own self-signed root CA certificate and have used that to sign various things, my web site, etc. I'm not giving detailed instructions on how to install these because you should only do this if you trust me and you REALLY know what you're doing. If you REALLY know what you're doing, you'll know how to do it.

### Windows / Linux

Efpophis.net.ca.crt - this can be imported into your trusted root CA store on Windows or Linux.

### Android

216c0a6b.0 - install this file to your /system/etc/security/cacerts on your rooted Android device.

### Github / GnuPG

efpophis.gpg - my gpg public key that I will be signing my github tags with.
